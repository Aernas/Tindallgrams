<p>Well, I just got back from MIT  with my weekly quota of new ulcers, which
I thought might interest you. We spent one day discussing the AS-2O4
situation, another on AS-501 and AS-502, and the tnird day primarily
on crew procedures associated with the LEM lunar rendezvous crew timeline. 
I will give you my impression on each of these things, but first
I would like to let you know that Ed Copps is coming down on June 16
and 17 to give us a first cut at the overall schedule situation and the 
status of the Program Development Plan which he Ems been putting together.
To help Ed in this urgent task, we have asked, and IBM (RTCC) has kindly 
agreed, to send people experienced in this area up to MIT for the first
several days of the week to assist Ed and his people in the assembly
of this information we so urgently need. Ed briefly described the format 
of the Program Development Plan, which is obviously closely patterned 
after IBM's and which seemed to me to be quite good if we really get it
working.</p>

<h1>AS-204 Status:</h1>

<p>Since this is the first time I have ever had anything to do with the
AS-204 program, I am sure my understanding of the situation is far from 
perfect; however, perhaps this estimate of the status of the program
might cause you to get the true status from someone who does know if
I say something here that interests you.</p>

<p>According to Ed Copps, all fixed memory of the computer is filled; and,
in fact, it was necessary to take out about 500 words of the reentry 
program associated with super-orbital entry in order to make it fit. 
(Incidentally, this suggests we my have a problem on the AS-205 program 
which is essentially the AS-204 program with about a 500-word routine
added in for support of an experiment unique to AS-205. I have asked
MIT to let us know at the earliest possible date if it is their opinion
that storage will preclude adding this program.)</p>

<p>A month or so ago some rather important guidance system capabilities 
were deleted from our requirements in order to improve the schedule situation 
enough to allow a June 8 release by MIT of a program which could 
support a nominal mission, the so-called "B release." This apparently 
did not do the job. The program has just been compiled in a single system 
and debugging is required in every area. In fact, according to
Ed Copps, not a single program sequence has been successfully run to 
completion yet. Thus, it was MIT's opinion that the program should not 
be released at this time. In fact, some of the programs--the 30 and 40
series--have not even been unit tested, although they have been included 
in the program assembly currently being used for system tests. This is 
certainly a very unsatisfactory situation.</p>

<p>MIT presented an abbreviated test plan for verification of this program, 
and it is my impression that the tests listed were to serve as part, if 
not all, of the formal verification and acceptance demonstration proposed 
by MIT. The list presented was not at all definttive but only described 
the runs in very general terms. The list consisted of twelve tests primarily 
designed to check capability of the program to support a nominal 
mission; it was estimated that these runs could be completed within four 
weeks. In addition, three other tests were identified associated with
a variety of non-nominal situations for which completion was estimated 
to be nine weeks.</p>

<p>Apparently Ed Copps does not expect the AS-2O4 program test results to
be formally documented, although Alex Kosmala says all this material
will be readily available on file. What a shame to have to accept a situation 
like that, but I suppose we have no real choice now.</p>

<p>It had been the i.ntention to prepare the B release program for spacecraft 
systems tests to be carried out in the altitude chamber at the Cape. 
As I noted before, it was desired on June 8. Aaron Cohen ascertained 
that June 23 was the very latest date this release could be made without 
causing a day-for-day slip in the launch schedule. This date is based
on the assumption that Raytheon will be able to manufacture the ropes
In four weeks as opposed to the previous time allotment of six weeks. 
Thus, you see it is evident that a program, flight-worthy in any sense, 
cannot be made available in time for spacecraft systems tests. In order 
to avoid the schedule slip, the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) 
decided to accept a program tape release for rope manufacture on June 23,
using the best program assembly MTT has had up ko that time.</p>

<p>The final flight tape must be released for rope manufacture at some time 
between July 15 and August 8. Actual freezing of the flight program 
must be based not only on the Cape schedule but also must take into account 
flight crew training since it is important that the training be 
carried out with the same assembly as is flown. We have every expectation 
that the flight program we finally must accept will be of less than 
desirable quality. It will not have undergone sufficient verification 
tests and will very likely still contain program bugs. Following the 
flight program test release, extensive effort will be carried out to 
determine the limitations and inadequacies of the program in order that 
operational procedures may be esbablished to work around them. Hopefully, 
none of these deficiencies will be so serious that the flight
may not be carried out on schedule.</p>

<p>It is our intention at MSC to maintain a close watch by locating our 
people at MIT most of the time such that we are immediately aware of 
the situation on a day-by-day basis. In addition, we intend to assist 
in whatever way possible in carrying out the test program, doing such
things as supplying information upon which test results may be compared, 
running analyses, etc. We also intend to re-examine the overall rope 
production situation since in the next several months Raytheon will be 
requested to manufacture a large number of ropes to the extent that their 
capacity may be exceeded. I certainly don't want anyone to think that
we feel the situation is any better than barely tolerable; on the other 
hand, as far as I can tell we are pretty well committed at this time 
with no alternative but to march along with our fingers crossed.</p>

<h1>AS-501 Status:</h1>
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
<p>Although the discussions on AS-501 started out being even more traumatic 
than AS-204, it looks like, maybe, we are going to come out of this one 
pretty well. Basically, we were told that the AS-501 and AS-502 program 
would be the AS-202 program with about 15% new formulation required. It 
was MIT's proposal that the entire program development task for the AS-501 
and AS-502 programs be assigned to AC Electronics. Their first estimate
was that the program tapes could be released for rope manufacture 
on about November 15, which is exactly three months too late. Rather
an interesting proposal, I thought, since it is so obviously so unacceptable. 
After recovering from our complete shock, we started looking into 
the alternatives available to us and came upon one which made some of us 
wonder why we weren't doing it that way in the First place; i.e., just 
using the AS-202 program as is with only minor madifications, such as 
changing a few of the constants. Theoretically, this should not only
put us on schedule, but maybe ahead of schedule. An effort has been
going on at MSC, under the leadership of Carl Huss, to determine just
what impact such a plan would have on the AS-501 and 502 flights. So
far, as problems have been identified, acceptable solutions have generally
been found; and it is my current impression that we shall be able to fly
AS-501 and AS-502 using the AS-202 program with very little modification
or impact on the mission objectives.</p>

<p>It appears that a somewhat greater burden will be placed on the ground 
support for carrying out the AS-5Ol and 502 flights using the AS-202
program in this way. The most significant disadvantage is that certain 
alternate mission flexibilities and some launch abort capability must
be given up. These capabilities would certainly be worthwhile if the 
schedule situation permitted. As soon as we are able to determine with 
some accuracy exactly what the situation is, this proposal will be carried 
to our management for the final decision. Incidentally, John Dahlen 
optimistically estimates that the GSOP for AS-501 will be available in 
about two weeks.</p>

<p>One most significant action was taken with regard to the concentric 
flight plan. It was the unanimous agreement of MSC and MIT personnel 
involved in this work that the concentric flight plan to be prograrmned 
for the Apollo guidance computer will be as it now exists in both the 
Rendezvous Analysis Branch and MIT. It is recognized that there are 
certain limitations to its use wherein under dispersed conditions it 
does not automatically produce a usable mission plan. However, through 
proper use of the input controls by the pilot--changing various parameters--it 
is possible to arrive at a solution if one is available. Accordingly, 
it was not felt to be fruitful nor would there appear to be 
time to permit further refinement of this formulation, and so we decided 
to proceed as noted with MSC accepting full respmsibility for these 
deficiencies, Our task from now on, then, is to conduct sufficient 
analysis to identify these deficiencies and to provide onboard and 
ground backup procedures to take care of them.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are still with me, you hardy reader, let me tell you 
what I intend to put maximum effort on next. I in willing to bet that 
we are going to be told that MET is behind schedule on AS-207/208 and 
maybe AS-503 and AS-504. On the obher hand, unless things change, we 
can probably expect to see the flight schedule accelerated, making the 
situation even worse. Although it is a pity to reduce the potential.
of this really sophisticated guidance system below its maximum, I see
no other choice but to go through that program and ruthlessly cull out 
many of its refinements in order to simplify the program to its most 
austere form for those early Block II flights. The program paring
must be done, I feel, solely for schedule reasons, which is really
kind of weird when you think about how long the programs have been 
under development. It will mean that we fly to the moon with a system 
which does not minimize fuel expenditure nor provides the close guidance 
tolerances which are ultimately within its capability.</p>

<p>Once we have determined what can be removed of this nature, I will be 
sure to let, you know, along with the costs--the waste of our precious 
propellants and increased miss distances. It will then be up to our 
management to decide whether these costs are acceptable or not. I 
have asked Norm Sears to prepare a first-cut at possible program deletions, 
based on this philosophy, and we will see if we can't add a few 
things to it when we go up there next week.</p>
