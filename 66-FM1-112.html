</header>

<p>In my notes of the AS-207/208 GSOP meeting with MIT, reference 66-FM1-100 
of August 30, I indicated that MIT was including an automatic data edit
scheme in the rendezvous navigational program for both the LM and the
CSM. As you recall, this scheme was to accept radar or SXT data automatically 
if its effect on the spacecraft state vector is less than some
pre-established amount and would reject it if its effect is greater then
some other (larger) pre-established amount. Data falling between these
two criteria was to be accepted but a warning light was to be turned
on. Dr. Shea commented that this seems unnecessarilly complicated - that
really there is no apparent sense in having three conditions when two
would do just as well. I must say, although I was foolish enough to
argue at the time, I certainly agree now that we really should make this
a imple binary decision. Use the data or don't use the data based on
some pre-established level of quality - probably light a light when the
computer is rejecting the data and do away with that central region
altogether. I have searched my memory and can't recall why MIT proposed
to do it that way, but unless someone can find a good reason, we should 
direct MIT to simplify the decision logic as noted above.</p>
