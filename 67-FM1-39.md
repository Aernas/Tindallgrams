It's becoming evident that we are entering a new epoch regarding development 
of spacecraft computer programs, and I thought I'd try to put my
impression relating to this into words and get them out in the open.

Until a few months ago, our most basic problem was getting the spacecraft
computer programs - and ultimately the flight ropes - completed in time
to support the official flight schedule. This presented such a challenge
to the people involved that intense reluctance was created to making
changes and, after a certain point, even correcting known deficiencies in
the programs. Where necessary, work around procedures were invented as
the only possible solution. Since the January accident the situation has
changed considerably in two ways. First of all, the flight schedule has 
slipped to an extent that computer program development no longer paces
the flights in any way (including crew training and system tests) and, 
secondly, the value of quality has become supreme. These things are most
clearly evident right now on LM-1 where it's almost unthinkable to fly
with any known deficiencies in the program - even those which would only
affect very low probability contingency situations - in spite of the fact
that the flight ropes have already been manufactured. I feel it's quite
likely the decision will be made to rework the LM-1 program and remanufacture 
ropes regardless of impact on any of MIT's program development
work, including delivery of the manned mission computer programs. In fact,
we have asked MIT to determine the extent of this across-the-board impact
assuming all of the known deficiencies in the LM-1 program are removed,
no matter how minor. Much more significant, howeverm is that without
doubt this situation is forcing us to adopt a new working philosophy
which should be recognized and included in all of our planning - program
develonment schedules, man loading, crew training_ spacecraft systems
tests, etc. It is clear that, as Ed Copps puts it, program "shelf life"
is very short. That is, it is extremely unlikely we will ever fly with
ropes manufactured substantially in advance of the mission; instead of
releasing the flight program for rope manufacture at the earliest possible
date we should release it at the latest possible date.

The next question to be answered is - how far should the work on these
assemblies proceed before being frozen (if you call slush "frozen")
and put on the shelf until some key milastone associated with spacecraft
flight readiness? Should complete flight qualiflcation Level 5 testing
be carried out with the realization that changes will come along forcing
us to revise the program and thus to repeat substantial portions of the
flight verification? Or should we merely carry the program development
through Level 4 testing, resulting in an assembly on the shelf which is
bug free as far as we know, but which has not been completely flight
qualified? There are arguments for both positions. We have asked MIT
to consider this subject - program development working philosophy - and
to recommend their preference. We here at MSC will do the same and within
a month will be prepared to adopt what appears to be the best over-all
compromise. In any case, I'm sure it will force us to maintain a larger
MIT staff and more program development facilities in order to be in a
position to maintain and modify these programs until we finally release
them. And we are less likely to have to throw sets of ropes in the
garbage can so often.

I'm not trying to flag this all out as a big problem area. It should
certainly be easier to handle than our previous "schedule is king - anything
is better than nothing" type of problem. But I'm sure what we do will
have some fairly significant implications on everyone involved in the
business of program development as well as the various users of their 
product and I thought it worthwhile to bring it to your attention
