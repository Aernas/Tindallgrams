The following is a verbatim copy of a note to me from Rick Nobles
(MPAD).  I thought it was worth distributing.

 \"The cross axis velocity errors resulting from SPS mistrim
(CSM alone) will be about one half of what was previously anticipated.
The reduction in error is due to the new DAP filter constants that
the G&CD is recommending for the \"C\" mission erasable load.  The only
adverse effect is the mission planning that has been done to date.\"
