1. During our December 21 Ascent P\[unintelligible\] Data Priority meeting we concluded
that a continuous launch window for lift off from the lunar surface is not
a requirement. That is, all \[unintelligible\] planning, procedures and program
development associated with the nominal lunar landing mission should be
based on the assumption that one or more discrete lift off times will be
selected for each revolution of the command module and failure to lift
off at one of those discrete times will result in a hold to the next
discrete time. Each of these lift off times will be selected to produce
the nominal differential altitude during the coelliptical rendezvous.
If more than one discrete lift off opportunity is provided per command
module revolution, it will be obtained by extending the rendezvous operation
another revolution with orbital adjustment maneuvers provided to
maintain the nominal differential altitude. (Personally, I feel one
opportunity each CSM revolution is enough but that's just my opinion.)
At this time, it appears that one additional revolution beyond the
rendezvous scheme currently planned would produce two additional discrete
windows after the nominal, one occurring 2 1/3 minutes later and the other
about 8 minutes after nominal.

2. If anyone can think of any reason why this constraint is unacceptable,
they should let their concern be known immediately. We could not think
of any reason except gross emergency which would produce the circumstance
wherein having missed a discrete time we would want to go to the earliest
possible time as opposed to waiting for the next preselected discrete
time. Of course, "anytime" launch capability is being provided throughout
the system but only for low probability contingency situations.
