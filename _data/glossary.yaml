    term: Fire-in-the-hole
    def: "When the LM’s Ascent Propulsion System was fired with the descent stage still attached, for instance if the mission were aborted during lunar landing, this was called ”Fire in the hole. ” The first test of this maneuver was planned for AS-207/208. After that mission was cancelled, it was ultimately tested during the unmanned Apollo 5 mission in January 1968. Nasa produced [a short film about Apollo 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po178Hs2dXI) that briefly explains FITH."

    term: "Gimbal Lock"
    def: "The loss of one degree of freedom in a three-dimensional space that occurs when the axes of two of the three gimbals are driven into a parallel configuration, “locking” the system into rotation in a degenerate two-dimensional space. More at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock)."

    term: Ullage
    def: "Ullage is the empty space in a liquid rocket’s fuel tank. In zero-gravity, the fuel of course tended to float around inside the tank. Before many maneuvers, rockets were gently fired for a short time “for ullage,” that is, to push all the fuel to the back of the tank so that calculations about how to maneuver the spacecraft would be simpler and more accurate."
