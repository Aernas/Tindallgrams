    term: "Apollo 1"
    def: "Originally designated AS-204, Apollo 1 was scheduled to be to launch on February 21, 1967 as the first manned Apollo mission. During a test on January 27, 1967, a fire in the crew compartment killed the three Apollo 1 austronauts, Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. This fire resulted in reappraisal of just about every goal, procedure, and schedule of the Apollo program."

    term: AS-207/208
    def: "AS-207/208 (also known as AS-278) was to have been the first test of the LM in Earth orbit. It was also to have be a dual mission with the command and lunar modules launched on separate Saturn 1Bs. The mission was cancelled after the Apollo 1 fire and the Saturn 1Bs were used to launch Skylab 3 (AS-207) on July 28, 1973 and Skylab 4 (AS-208) on November 16, 1978. The LM was first tested by Apollo 5 in January 1968."

    term: Fire-in-the-hole
    def: "When the LM’s Ascent Propulsion System was fired with the descent stage still attached, for instance if the mission were aborted during lunar landing, this was called ”Fire in the hole. ” The first test of this maneuver was planned for AS-207/208. After that mission was cancelled, it was ultimately tested during the unmanned Apollo 5 mission in January 1968. Nasa produced [a short film about Apollo 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po178Hs2dXI) that briefly explains FITH."
