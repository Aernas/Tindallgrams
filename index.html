    <h1>What are Tindallgrams?</h1>

    <p>In 1966, as the American space program was working furiously towards a 
    moon landing, Howard W. “Bill” Tindall, Jr., arrived at MIT to oversee the
    development of software for the spacecraft guidance systems. Guidance 
    systems where revoutionary, there was controversy over how astronauts and 
    computers would share control of the spaceflights, and software was a new 
    aspect of systems engineering whose importance was vastly underappreciated.
    Tindall found a lot of brilliant people at MIT working in development 
    program that was behind schedule, was failing to meet its requirements, and 
    threatened to become, in his words, “the most pacing item for the Apollo 
    flights.” He dove into the task of refashioning every aspect of the software 
    development process, writing a series of frank memos that entered NASA lore
    under the name “Tindalgrams.”</p>

    <p>Various people kept more or less official collections of these 
    Tindallgrams, some of which have been available on the internet as PDFs for 
    years, but there was no simple, searchable, indexable text version. So I 
    thought it would be interesting to make a Github project out of them. Those 
    of us who deal with the challenged involved in open source software -- the
    loosely coordinated software development processes and widely distributed
    collaborations -- certainly have a lot to learn from Bill Tindall and his
    success in turning the ideas of a group of smart hackers into a working 
    system that landed men on the moon and returned them safely to the Earth.</p>
