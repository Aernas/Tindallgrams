1. Those who participated in the STAC presentation already know this,
but perhaps some of you, like me, had not heard. It is currently 
proposed that on the lunar landing mission the first two hours on the 
lunar surface will be devoted to spacecraft systems checks and launch
preparations which, for all practical purposes, simulates the final 
two hours before ascent and rendezvous. Going through an operation
 like this has a number of obvious benefits. It's a good pre-ascent 
"simulation" which lets you find out early if there are problems 
associated with that operation such as performing the necessary tasks 
within the time allotted. And, of course, it prepares the spacecraft 
for lift off at the end of the command module's first revolution if
that action is required in response to some emergency situation. Also, 
it makes the countdown for that event the same as the countdown for
the nominal ascent lunar stay---that is, standardizes procedures.

2. In preparing our mission techniques data flow we are assuming that 
the lunar operation will be conducted in this way. I assume those
responsible for planning other facets of the lunar operation are doing 
the same.
