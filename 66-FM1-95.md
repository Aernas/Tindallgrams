During the week of July 4, 1966, the prime and backup crews for the AS-204 
mission attended briefings at MIT, which, among other things led to
their request that four changes be made in the spacecraft computer program
for that mission. This request triggered off a considerable amount 
of activity which I would like to record here, indicating the final outcome
of it all.

In discussing the overall AS-204 computer program situation with MIT
people on July 14, 1966, I was told that a flight-worthy program would
probably not exist on August 8, the date we had established for the release
of the flight program tape for rope manufacture. That is, according to
the best MIT estimate, the program would still contain bugs and would not
have satisfactorily completed its flight acceptance verification. They
felt that delaying delivery of this program two weeks--that is, until 
August 22--was necessary to assure flight readiness. They also indicated
that three of the four pilot requested program changes could be made with
little or no impact during this period of time. These changes are as follows.

1. Choice of heads-up or heads-down spacecraft attitude during SPS maneuvers.
2. Display of latitude and longitude after completion of reentry guidance.
3. Display of the sensed retrograde maneuver--three Î”V's in the IMU platform coordinates system.

They estimated that the fourth change--providing a pilot choice of displays
during launch powered flight and immediately after insertion into
orbit--would delay tape release an additional week beyond the August 22
date.

My personal view of this situation is somewhat different than MIT's.
Considering our experience in the past, I question whether a truly flight-worthy
program can be delivered on August 22, even without changes, and
I'm certain that any attempt to make changes will only reduce our chances.
The people who are currently carrying out the program checkout would have
to make these changes, so obviously some of their effort must be diverted.

In addition to that, these program changes would certainly make further
program checkout necessary and would tend to nullify some of that work
which has already been carried out. Furthermore, although it would be
nice for the crew to have these additional capabilities, there does not
seem to be any technical justification for classifying them as mandatory.
Accordingly, it was my recommendation, supported by a number of other MSC
people, that none of the crew recommended changes be made in the AS-204
program. This recommendation was accepted by the G&N Subsystem Manager
and the Apollo Program Manager. And, that is how the situation stands 
now.

One item of particular concern to the crew was the apparent lack of well
established crew procedures for making a GO NO-GO decision onboard the
spacecraft following S-IVB shutdown. Although the ground is primary for
this function, as it has been on past manned programs, it would certainly
be highly desirable to have this onboard capability, particularly recognizing
the somewhat poor ground monitoring and communications available
during Apollo launch. Furthermore, such a capability is very nearly
within our grasp, which makes it even more tantalizing. In reviewing
the status of the work going on in support of this onboard function, I
find that sticking to the current onboard displays will somewhat delay
availability of charts for the crew to use in this mission phase. Specifically,
this work, which has been primarily directed toward development 
of the RTCC/MCC capability, is now estimated to be within about four
weeks of completion and crew charts could have been made available at
about that time if V, ?, and h were displayed onboard the spacecraft.
However, since special charts will be needed for use with the parameters
to be displayed to the crew, an additional one or two weeks will be needed
for their preparation. Therefore it is estimated that they will be available
on about September 1.

In summary, MIT feels the earliest date a flight-ready program could be
delivered for AS-204 is about August 22, and MSC is authorizing delay of
the flight program tape release at least until that date. In order to
give greater assurance that the program will be flight-ready on that date,
no program changes are being authorized. In the absence of the most desirable
of these onboard computer program changes, specifically the provision
of displays onboard the spacecraft for making GO NO-GO decision
after launch booster shutdown, special charts must be prepared, which
will take about two weeks longer than if the changes were made, but should
be ready on about September 1.
