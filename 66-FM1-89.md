As you know, the rendezvous orbit navigation process involves updating
the spacecraft state vector based on the spacecraft radar data. However, 
the radar apparently has unacceptably large angular bias errors
for some reason. Instead of fixing the damn radar, someone decided to
include in the LEM spacecraft computer program the capability of computing 
these radar angle biases at the same time the spacecraft state
vector is updated. Once these biases have been determined to the computer's 
satisfaction, they are not updated further; that is, they are
assumed to remain unchanged thereafter.

There is a contingency, however, which would cause them to change, so
I'm told, and that is if the LEM were to undergo loss of pressurization.
It had been MIT's intention to provide an option in their rendezvous orbit determination program to reinitialize the computer such that it would
redetermine the radar angle biases in this event. However, in line with
our campaign to simplify the computer program, this option is being deleted, 
which means that, in the event of spacecraft pressurization loss,
the radar angle bias may be in error by some fraction of a degree. This
does not disable the rendezvous guidance system, but rather may cause
some loss of efficiency in the use of propulsion fuel. Just how much
depends on when it happens, of course, but the maximum extra cost is
not expected to exceed about 50 ft/sec. We'll get a better estimate
of this cost and make sure it's acceptable.

Ed Lineberry, how about you getting that done. In the meantime, we're
telling MIT to take this option out unless we're directed to do otherwise.
