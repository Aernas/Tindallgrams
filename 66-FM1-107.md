Since our meeting in your office on the stable orbit rendezvous, Ed
Lineberry and I have met on a number of occasions with other interested
people in an attempt to lay out a schedule of work needed to arrive at
the decision as to how to go on 278 and subsequent missions. This note
is to let you know the things we (MSC) intend to do and when we expect
to get them done. As you will see, most of the work is being done by the
Flight Crew Support Division and Guidance Control Division since the most
significant difference from the old Concentric Flight Plan (CFP) involves
the terminal phase of the rendezvous.

1. Paul Kramer, FCSD, has assigned a task to McDonnell Aircraft Co.
to perform man-in-the-loop simulations of both the stable orbit rendezvous
technique and the CFP with comparable approach velocities. Simulation of
both systems will be initiated with the transfer maneuver. The approach
velocities will be equivalent to the CFP with differential altitude varying
from about 5 to 15 nautical miles. All failures modes will be investigated.
It is intended to start this three-week effort on about September
19.

2. GCD has two studies going. The first is an evaluation of the
CSM optical rendezvous guidance system to determine its accuracies and
performance when operating in a stable orbit type rendezvous. The prime
objective of this study is to determine the magnitude of the dispersions
to be expected in the on-board computed maneuvers starting with the
transfer from the stable orbit point. It is anticipated that this analysis
will be completed by mid-October.

3. The second GCD study concerns the braking phase. Ron Simpson is
in charge of this investigation which is primarily an expansion of one
previously carried out for higher closing rates. He intends to start
with conditions corresponding to CFP differential altitudes of between
5 and 15 miles. As I understand it, his man-in-the-loop simulations are
usually initiated at about a l0 mile range. The purpose, of course, is to
determine if there is some preferred closing rate going into the braking
maneuver. These runs will be performed both with and without a cockpit
display of range and range rate. He expects to start this analysis in
mid-September with the results to be available early in October.

4. We are doing some things in MPAD too, of course, but they are
not as extensive as I indicated they might be during our meeting. Ed
Lineberry's people are carrying out analyses aimed at selection of the
optimum transfer angle (ωt) and trailing displacement for the stable
orbit rendezvous technique. These two parameters are probably interrelated
growing larger together to keep the closing rate meaningful in
the face of dispersions. We still expect the preferred trailing displacement
to be in the order of 15 to 20 nautical miles. At present the
two prime candidates for ωt are 292° and 330°. 292°, you recall, has
the advantage of providing the same approach conditions - primarily
minimum inertial line of sight rates - as the CFP. This was the transfer
angle used on the Gemini XI re-rendezvous which, in effect, checked out
a ground controlled (perfectly!) CFP with braking without a radar simulating
a differential altitude of 5 nautical miles. The 330° figure was
jointly selected by MSC and MAC for the Gemini XII re-rendezvous based
on lighting considerations and time available to make mid-course corrections.
The objective was to provide as large a value of ωt as possible
while avoiding the unique problems associated with a 360° transfer in
the presence of out-of-plan and altitude dispersions. (Incidentally,
McDonnell is carrying out a considerable amount of work both in terms
of dispersion analysis and the preparation of flight crew rendezvous
charts. Much of this work will be applicable to our effort.)

5. In addition, the mission planning for the Gemini XII re-rendezvous
is being constrained as much as possible to duplicate the AS-278
initial CSM rendezvous conditions. In particular, we are trying to
duplicate the ground tracking orbit determination capabilities as well as
the relative motion trajectories to simulate the stable orbit rendezvous
technique.

6. As you may recall, we originally estimated development of ten
reference trajectories was required to provide information for the big
decision. We have concluded that it is virtually impossible to do that
much work in a reasonable length of time, regardless of how we redistribute.
our manpower. However, RAB is developing a reference trajectory for
the nominal lunar rendezvous assuming an on-time LM lift off. It will be
a two-impulse, minimum ΔV trajectory to the stable orbit position. Once
this is completed they intend to perturb the LM insertion conditions up
to the 3 Sigma performance of the Abort Guidance System and the Ascent
Propulsion System in order to determine the effects of these dispersions
on the Delta V. Their work will be based on the assumption that there
is a perfect knowledge of the situation at the time of the maneuvers and
that they are executed perfectly. Ed anticipates that this work will be
completed around the middle of October.

Finally, we are issuing a program change notice to MIT to provide an
offset rendezvous target capability - trailing position only. I should
point out that some resistance is expected to this program change,
primarily from the FCOD since there are many other capabilities they give
much higher priority which we have not agreed to implement so far. I am
not certain how ASPO will react either since, as I understand it, TRW has
reported to Joe Shea that they see no significant advantage to this
technique.

Also associated with all this, the AS-207/208 Reference Trajectory is to
be issued on about September 23. As you are probably aware, there are a
large number of unresolved areas on this complex mission primarily due
to the uncertainty associated with the AS-206 mission; thus, the quality
of this Reference Trajectory is going to be questionable in any case.
Unfortunately it will continue to show the initial CSM active rendezvous
as a CFP type with a differential altitude of 20 nautical miles.
Although it does not correspond to the planned documentation schedule,
I really expect another Reference Trajectory will have to be issued
prior to the release of the Operational Trajectory. Therefore, if we
change to the stable orbit rendezvous, that will either be reflected in
the new Reference Trajectory, or we will issue an addendum of some sort
such as an internal note documenting the change.

Chris, this has been a tough problem and, believe it or not, we have
spent a lot of time developing this plan for getting the answers you and
Sig want. If there is something else you think we should be doing, please
let me know.
