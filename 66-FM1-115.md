This note is intended to document my understanding of the situation with
regard to the spacecraft computer programs for the alternate AS-278
mission. In particular, I would like to record how we are responding to
the current programming needs in this area.

Although it was originally stated as a ground rule that alternate missions
would be flown using the same programs developed for the primary missions,
it appears that that will not be possible in this instance; e.g., there
are two contingencies the Apollo Program Office feels it is mandatory to
be prepared for. One is an extended schedule slip on the delivery on the
first LM spacecraft, and the second is the failure of the AS-206 mission
of such a nature that it is not possible to carry out the AS-278 mission
as currently planned. The alternate mission (AS-278B) in both of these
instances is to rendezvous the AS-207 command module with a LM, man the
LM, perform certain spacecraft systems tests and then to initiate a
programmed sequence very similar if not identical to the current AS-206
mission after returning the crew to the command module. We are now
attempting to determine precisely which additional processors must be
added to the AS-206 program in order to permit making such a flight. Of
course, the additional requirements depend on precisely how this mission
is to be flown, which in turn depends on the guidance system capabilities;
e.g., we are in the familiar little cycle. At the least, it appears that
the capability must exist to power up the system and align the platform
in orbit; however, even these things are not certain.

I have asked Paul Stull and Tom Price to contact the various ASPO and
MPAD personnel involved in this mission planning to pin down the possible
alternatives for flying this mission, leading to a precise definition of
additional program requirements to the 206 program. It is our intention
to direct MIT to give the identified processors, which theoretically are
already needed in the AS-208 program, highest possible priority such that
they may be added to the 206 program at the most opportune time. It
appears certain that they will have to be added at some time; e.g., it
appears certain a program must be developed to support this type of a
flight. There is some question, however, as to whether the 206 program
as currently defined is needed since the modified program should be able
to fly both the 206 mission and the AS-278B mission. Our basic problem
is providing this augmented program in time to support the 206 mission if
it is flown; i.e., it depends on the schedule of that flight and the
program development required for it.

Accordingly, it is our intention to continue working on the present
AS-206 program as currently defined until the latest time at which a
decision can be made, probably in the latter part of November or early
in December. It is at this time that the final 206 program integration
and flight acceptance verification testing will be going on. If, at that
time, it is apparent the 206 flight has slipped sufficiently to permit
adding the additional processors to support the AS-278B mission, work on
the 206 program would be terminated and only this augmented program would
be developed for use both on the AS-206 and AS-278B. If the current 206
schedule is maintained, however, we would be forced to complete flight
qualified 206 program ropes to be followed later by the augmented AS-206
program for support of the AS-278B mission.

Although some preliminary information has been obtained from MIT regarding
over-all schedule impact, it is my intuitive feeling that it is
probably not particularly accurate. Therefore, it is my intention to
obtain program development plans for the augmented AS-206 program which
will include the effect of work on this program on the AS-278/503 and
504 program schedules.

This will be done as soon as the additional program requirements for the
AS-278B mission have been defined.
