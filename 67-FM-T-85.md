1\. Just for the record, I would like to record a list of program development
improvement ideas which MIT plans to incorporate. This list was gleaned
from discussions by Ed Copps, Fred Martin, and Alex Kosmala during the week of October
2, 1967.

a) Much more complete program structure design work will be done
prior to program integration. This includes more precise definition of the program module interfaces. And I suppose things like allotment of computer memory.

b) Control of program constants will be exercised to insure their
accuracy and to avoid duplication from one procedure into another.

c) In order to avoid the problem of erasable memory conflicts a panel is
being established to manage the use of erasable memory.

d) MIT proposes to initiate a series of periodic internal program design reviews.

e) Approved program changes will be considered by MIT as they arrive
from MSC but
will be added into the flight program assemblies in blocks periodically
as opposed to randomly as in the past.

f) Much tighter assembly control will be exercised with all program
modifications being monitored and reviewed by a higher level of MIT
management. Only those changes really necessary will be permitted.
New assemblies will only be produced once a week as opposed to the
much higher frequency hitherto.

g) Associated with assembly control, specific processors will be "sealed"
internally in the assembly as they become operational as opposed to the
current practice of putting the entire program under configuration
control when all components are working.

h) It is my understanding that at present digital autopilots
(DAP) are available for both the LM and command module. On the other
hand, design improvements will probably be necessary on a fairly continuous basis. All modifications in the DAP's will be made and checked
out in some program other than the current flight program assembly used
by the rest of the program development personnel. Modified DAP's will
only be added to this working, assembly when they are running properly.

i) Much more coordination and communication between the various
groups involved in software development is essential. It is Martin's
intention to establish standing committees with periodic meetings for
this purpose. These meetings will also be used for consideration and
coordination of proposed changes.

j) Apparently, in the past development of program test plans has
been carried out by a small group without much assistance, advice or
coordination with other interested parties. Wider participation in
this effort both at MIT and MSC is planned.

k) MIT has finally decided to utilize discrepancy reporting like
we have requested for well over a year and which has recently proven
to be of great value to them in the latter stages of the SUNDISK
development. They intend to utilize this from the beginning on the
remaining programs.

l) Associated with the discrepancy reporting, MIT will maintain
an up-to-date operational constraint list. Obviously, one way in
which discrepancies may be eliminated is by establishing work around
procedures or operational constraints on program usage.

m) Steps are being taken to make sure that as problems are found
and corrected in one major program these same flaws are corrected in
the other programs (e.g., SUNDANCE and COLOSSUS).

n) Slow response in the exchange of data, particularly spacecraft
characteristics, has delayed MIT previously. Steps are being taken at
both MIT and MSC to provide faster response. When necessary, in lieu
of answers from MSC, MIT proposes to state their assumptions and proceed
ahead with program development to avoid delays of this type.

2\. As you can see, nothing particularly startling here but I believe
everyone would agree those are all good things to do, that is, they
should improve the quality of the program itself and should certainly
result in getting the job done faster. MIT has recently reorganized
their personnel somewhat, hopefully in a way that will allow them to
implement these ideas effectively.
