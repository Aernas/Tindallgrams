</header>

<p>On July 7, 1966, a team of MSC and MIT "experts in rendezvous" (including 
Paul Krammer, Ed Lineberry, John Dahlen, and Norm Sears) met
at MIT to discuss and review the preliminary Guidance System Operation
Plan (GSOP) which MIT has unofficially distributed, covering the terminal 
phase and External ΔV programs for the AS-207/208 mission. This
meeting was sort of a mile-pebble in the accelerated program development 
sequence we have established in an attempt to get all this business
on schedule. That is, we are obtaining bits and pieces of the GSOP as
they come off the MIT press rather than awaiting receipt of the formally
published, final document.</p>

<p>It is our hope that, by reviewing and commenting on these pieces as
they become available, the GSOP should be virtually acceptable without
modification on the date of its publication and should permit the computer 
program development to proceed much more quickly than it has in
the past. We had previously discussed these mission programs and our
pilot inpat and display requirements for them in detail a month or so
ago with MIT, and the pieces of the GSOP I am talking about here reflected 
that input very well. Therefore, most of the discussion was
for purposes of clarification to assure a firm understanding on both
MSC's and MIT's part as to what this program was really going to do and
how we were going to operate it. Basically, very few modifications were
considered necessary.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this meeting was highly successful; and, since these
processors--the terminal phase and External ΔV--are the most significant 
new requirements and the most controversial of the mission programs, 
I feel we are probably over the hump as far as defining the
program for the AS-207/208 mission.</p>

<p>I would like to point out here the two items given the most attention
at this meeting since they serve well to describe the character of the
terminal phase rendezvous guidance philosophy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1. One of the capabilities of most interest which we have provided
	was the display of range, range rate, and the angle the spacecraft X-axis
	makes with respect to the local horizontal. It was decided to make these
	three quantities available at crew request at any time the data was
	available. (This stuff is used for carrying out the crew backup procedures.) 
	Contrary to one of my previous reports, these quantities will 
	all be computed based on the current best estimate of the two spacecraft
	state vectors. (We had previously expressed an intention for the computer to display raw radar range and range rate in the LEM). Our action
	in this case was based on our desire to make the CSM and LEM computer
	programs as much the same as possible, and, since the raw radar data is
	available on what is said to be a highly accurate analog display in the
	LEM we have not really lost anything. In order to make this particular
	feature of the program as independent as possible from the automatic
	guidance system processing, we have divorced the display of these quantities 
	from the activity associated with the primary guidance system to
	the maximum extent.</li>

	<li>2. Based on Gemini experience, the crew has emphasized that there
	is no requirement for automatic execution of the braking maneuvers by
	the G&amp;N system. As previously reported, it is felt that this task can
	be carried out just as well, if not better, by the crew if they are provided 
	the proper information; namely, the range and range rate data.
	At least this is true in the case of the nominal mission and most contingency 
	situations, and we want to take advantage of that. However,
	there are occasions when automatic control of these maneuvers by the
	G&amp;N might be mandatory. For example, visual acquisition is required for
	the crew to carry out this task, and under some abort situations lighting
	conditions can be unacceptable. Also, there are abort cases in which
	the closing velocity is too high for effective manual control. Recognizing 
	that procedures are available for utilizing the remaining computer 
	processors to cairry out the G&amp;N controlled braking maneuvers by
	proper pilot manipulation of the computer, we deleted the requirement
	for automatic computer logic for this task. The point is, we felt that
	there was insufficient justification to carry out the extra programming,
	debugging, verification, and documentation, as well as using some 50 to
	100 words of precious computer storage, for a program which was not
	needed, except in rather remote contingency situations, as long as procedures 
	were available to handle all situations. And, they are.</li>
</ul>

<p>The final GSOP shall reflect these characteristics; otherwise, it was
accepted pretty well as is.</p>

<p>In the course of our discussions, I learned some rather interesting things
about the command module which I must say didn't impress me very favorably. 
In fact, I really wonder (i.e., doubt) if it is possible for one
crew member to carry out a rendezvous in the CSM. For example, the only
observational data available to the computer is from the sextant, and
that requires manual tracking and input of observations into the computer.
(The LEM has automatic radar tracking with its data available to the
computer as it periodica]ly requests it.) And, of course, in order for
the pilot to use this system, he has to be down in the navigation area
of the spacecraft, which means he has to quit making observations sometime 
before any SPS maneuver to get strapped into his seat. On top of
that, the sextant apparently can't be oriented along any of the major
spacecraft axes, which makes it necessary to orient to some attitude
not consistent with making RCS midcourse maneuvers.</p>

<p>I'll bet that when we finally get a crew timeline on a CSM one-man
rendezvous, he has to do it without any observational data available
to the computer after about 15 minutes before TPI. If my guess is
right, in effect we have provided practically no CSM G&amp;N rendezvous
guidance system, and thus the job will end up being carried out pretty
much using the crew backup procedures. Boy!</p>
