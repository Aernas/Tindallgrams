I really blew it at the June 5 Apollo Spacecraft Software Configuration 
Control Board meeting. Although dozens of rather minor changes were 
approved, the one I was most concerned about wasn't even discussed and I 
completely forgot it. This memo is to inform you that we are now 
desperately trying to include a capability in the LM computer program for a 
lunar landing flight in November which substantially improves descent 
abort targeting and procedures. Currently the LM descent abort programs 
target the spacecraft to insertion conditions which is not entirely 
accurate. This is because the more sophisticated equations required to 
do the job right were too complicated to get in the program for the G 
mission and we settled for some approximations that only do a pretty 
good job. Unfortunately, if we have a descent abort this makes it 
necessary to trim the insertion conditions based on ground targeting. 
This is the so-called "tweak" maneuver you've heard so much about which 
either the LM or command module must execute shortly after LM insertion 
into orbit. It is a messy procedure and the program change proposed will 
eliminate the need. Furthermore, for aborts late in powered descent 
(that is, after PDI + 10 minutes) it is necessary for the LM to execute 
a phasing maneuver approximately one-half rev after insertion to set up 
the proper rendezvous conditions. This, too, is a messy ground targeted 
procedure which will be eliminated if this program change is implemented. 

Although I wanted to tell you about that, my main purpose in writing this 
memo was to inform you that in order to get this program change in we have 
to sacrifice some other things and I thought you should have an opportunity 
to complain if you wanted to. First of all, storage has again become a 
problem and so we propose that, if necessary, MIT should delete the two 
Stable Orbit Rendezvous targeting program (P38 and P39) from the LM 
program. We have never discovered an operational use for these programs 
but maybe this deletion may bug somebody. (Incidentally, in order to 
provide more room for the dozen or so other changes already approved, the 
externally targeted Lambert pre-thrust program (P31) has already been 
deleted.) The other capability which may have to be dropped is the rendezvous 
radar automatic acquisition provided by the PGNCS during the Descent Abort 
programs (P70 and P71). Disabling this capability (R29), may be required 
to avoid a computer cycle problem. That is, obviously the computer can 
only do so much in a given period of time and it is MIT's option that 
adding the proposed sophistication in the guidance may cause us to exceed 
that limitation. This in turn forces us to give up another task and we 
have chosen the so-called Rendezvous Radar Designate Routine. 

This final paragraph is on another subject, but I thought I would point 
out that one of the more significant capabilities added last Thursday 
was the capability for the crew to readout raw rendezvous radar range and 
range rate data on the DSKY during the operation of the Rendezvous 
Navigation program (P20). This capability had been requested several times 
previously but never made it in to the program due to scheduling problems. 
It is a real nice thing to have.
