I used to think MIT was a little odd when it came to selecting names for the 
spacecraft computer programs with all that weird preoccupation with the sun.
But now I see they were right all the time and the rest of the world is nuts - let's name the missions sequentially as they lift off the launch pad.
Good grief, Charlie Brown! Having seen my error I'd like to apologize to 
our Bostonian friends for the abuse - and worse - I used to heap upon them
and publicly announce the end of my campaign to change the program names. I 
think the old ones are Just great and recommend you learn to recognize them if you're interested, in this business.

There are only five names you need to remember; they are:

a. _SOLRUM 55_

This contraction of the more familiar "Revision 55 of Solarium" was
adopted for the AS-501/AS-502 program when it was released to Raytheon for
rope manufacture. (The numerical part of the name is the number of the
program assembly on which the final flight verification testing was carried 
out. This is a characteristic of all program names).

b. _BURST 116_

Contracted from "Revision 116 of Sunburst", this is the name of the program for the unmanned LM mission we used to call AS-206.

c. _SUNDISK_

Sundisk is the interim Command Module program now scheduled for release in July which could be used for any earth orbital development flight. 
It probably won't ever be flown but it's availability will ensure that flight 
software does not pace the first manned mission. Dave Hoag suggested I 
could remember this name if I associated it with the shape of the command 
module - sort of a disk - and, by golly, it's worked for me.

d. _COLOSSUS_

This is the name of the command module program designed to support the lunar landing mission as well as all development flights anyone has
thought of, so far. According to Webster's New Collegiate Dictonary it
also means (1) A statue of gigantic size; as, the Colossus of Rhodes, a
statue of Apollo, about 120 feet high, made by Chares about 280 B.C. 
(2) Anything of gigantic size.

Pretty good except, I miss the Sun.

This program And Sundance (below) will undoubtedly be updated prior to rope 
manufacture for each mission, incorporating modifications and corrections 
as necessary. I expect these will be identified by different assembly numbers 
rather than completely new names.

e. _SUNDANCE_

You can remember the name of the LM program for all manned missions
by associating dance with the LM's lovely legs - another of Dave's suggestions - 
and adding "Sun" as usual.

I'm serious, as usual.
