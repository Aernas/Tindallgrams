One of the most significant decisions coming out of the AS-278 computer
program review with the Apollo Spacecraft Program manager on September
15 and 16, was his absolute assurance that the spacecraft computer memory
would not be augmented for the AS-503 or AS-504 flights. Accordingly,
all program development should proceed on that basis for those flights.

On the other hand: I would hope and expect that work will continue on
the auxiliary memory for follow-on missions, and I feel we should offer
whatever assistance MIT can provide on a non-interference basis to that
effort.
