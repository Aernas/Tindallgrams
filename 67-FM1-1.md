subject: Uplink will be on LM-4

A decision was made yesterday which I am sure will make a lot of people
happy. ASPO has finally decided to equip the LM-4 with a digital uplink.
Obviously, the associated computer programs must be added to the 
AS-504 LM program. I assume that these are the same as those developed 
for AS-208 and should present no significant problem.

Apparently it is too late to equip the AS-503 LM in this way, but since we are using the AS-208 program for that mission, that has no influence 
on our programming requirements. Please take whatever action is appropriate
regarding technical direction to MIT.
