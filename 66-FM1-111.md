According to the notes I made during the 278 GSOP review at MIT last
August, there was apparently still some question as to whether an
automatic radar search mode was needed.  Sears also questioned whether
an automatic sextant search mode was needed on the command module.

Has anything been done to answer either of these questions?  If so,
what?  If not, what can we do to close out these items?
