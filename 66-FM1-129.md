One of the possible actions which has been identified to help our spacecraft
computer program development schedule is to fly the AS-503 mission
with the AS-278 programs.  I have indicated in previous memoranda that
in order to do this we would probably have to add several routines to the
AS-278 program to make it applicable to AS-503.  However, as we have
studied this matter in more detail, we have arrived at a point where only
one routine is still considered a candidate -- some guidance of the SIVB
simulating TLI.  This is a command module program.  There are no additions
contemplated for the LGC.  Those interested in exactly what capability
would be available are referred to the AS-278 GSOP.

I am sure if we proceed in this way that it will have some impact on
establishment of the final mission requirements, and in turn will influence
how certain of the spacecraft capabilities for the lunar mission must be
tested prior to making the AS-504 flight.  I would like to call your
attention particularly to the fact that we shall have no navigation (orbit
determination) capability other than that associated with rendezvous for
the AS-278 and AS-503 missions, nor will we have the ascent or descent
guidance equations in the LGC.  There has been much discussion on the
testing of all of these.  Based on recent discussions with ASPO mission
planning people, I really don't expect that any mission requirements
affected by this decision are of such a mandatory nature that we would
be directed to proceed other than I have indicated above.  Obviously, if
this is incorrect, the sooner we find out about it the better.

Somewhat associated with this, it seems worthwhile to me to provide a
list of the additions to the AS-278/503 program which will have to be
made for 504.  This list, presented below, is MIT's current best estimate
and is by no means final, official or definitive, but perhaps it will
serve to let you know what the job we have before us is as well as giving
you some idea of the capabilities we intend to provide for AS-504.

_CMC_
1.  Return to earth
2.  LOI guidance
3.  Direct intercept targeting routine
4.  Navigation
	a.  SXT star/horizon and star/landmark
	b.  Lunar landmark
5.  Boost monitor
6.  Orbit integration additions for
    a.  Trans-lunar operations
    b.  Lunar operations
7.  Lunar ephemeris program
8.  Lunar rotation routine
9.  Lunar landing prediction routine
10.  LGC initialization
11.  Lunar landmarks (28)

_LGC_
1.  Descent Holman Injection guidance
2.  Lunar landing guidance
3.  Ascent guidance
4.  Direct intercept targeting routine
5.  Orbit integration
    a.  Remove earth orbit
    b.  Add Lunar
6.  Lunar rotation
7.  Lunar landing time prediction
8.  LGC initialization program changes
9.  Post landing service programs such as IMU angle storage
10.  Lunar surface IMU alignment
    a.  Normal
    b.  AOT failure
11.  Launch time determination
12.  AGS initialization program changes

Finally, I suppose I ought to add the following remark based strictly on
my own intuition -- namely, we have almost certainly got a computer
storage problem on the AS-504 programs again if all the above items are
added to the AS-278 program, particuarly with all of the special flexibilities
and options which will be suggested.  Therefore, the fact that
your favorite processors are listed above does not necessarily mean that
we will be able to get them all in.
