TRW Systems released the AS-207/208 Preliminary Spacecraft Reference
Trajectory during the first week of May. This report was put together
on a compressed schedule, starting from rather hastily defined mission
requirements. As a result, there are a number of things about it which
were recognized as being in error even before release; however, since
we have started so late in the development of this mission plan, it
was felt the release of a rough cut such as this was better than to
delay for a more polished one. This is not to criticize the TRW report; considering the conditions they did a good job. However, since
a large number of directly concerned people were interested in learning
about this mission plan in detail and since it was desirable to identify
as many corrections as possible right away, I set up an informal presentation by TRW on May 11, to be attended by whoever was interested.
At this meeting TRW reviewed the trajectory-oriented aspects of the
AS-207/208 mission plan with primary emphasis on the four rendezvous
exercises currently scheduled. The purpose of this memorandum is to
document the discrepancies and open items discussed during the meeting.
Assignment of action items was not the objective of this meeting and
none were assigned.

I would like to start out with a personal observation about this mission:
Beyond a doubt, this mission plan is presently at least an order of magnitude 
more complex than any mission we will have flown before it. It
was designed in an attempt to satisfy an overwhelming list of mission
objectives established to test out spacecraft systems and crew procedures, 
both for nominal and for contingency situations. It is my feeling
that, unless these mission objectives can be considerably cut back, we
may be embarking on an unrealistic undertaking, including the development 
of a nominal mission plan which can really satisfy all of these
objectives, the development of complex crew procedures, both to carry
out that plan and to handle contingency-contingencies, and, perhaps
most significant, the dumping of an overwhelming, if not impossible,
load on the flight crew, not only for preparation and training for the
mission, but also its actual execution. This crew will be expected to
check out the first Block II CSM, man and check out a LEM for the first
time, perform three or four completely different rendezvous exercises
with different guidance systems and procedures, carry out two EVA exercises, 
perform a number of contingency operations, such as switching
over from one guidance system to another during primary engine burns,
simulate crew rescue interms of both rendezvous and crew transfer from
one spacecraft to another by EVA, and so forth. It is to be noted that
all of this is supposed to be done with spacecraft which have been designed for a specific mission--the lunar landing. That is, they have
not been developed with operational flexibility as a design criteria.

And so with that introduction, I would like to record here a number of
the specific comments of this discussion:

1. _CSM/S-IVB Separation_: The Preliminary Spacecraft Reference
Trajectory has the command module separating from the S-IVB after 1 hour
and 41 minutes of mission time. We were informed that agreements currently 
in effect with MSFC call for the CSM to stay with the S-IVB for
at least two orbits and unless there is some problem associated with
this, it would probably be preferable to retain that procedure.

2. _S-IVB Venting_: There was some question as to how we would handle 
the problem.of spurious S-IVB venting in the event rendezvous is
not carried out at the time scheduled. Of particular concern was the
possibility of venting during the latter part of the rendezvous, with
the problem becoming more critical during the braking and docking maneuvers. According to the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO), MSFC
is waiting for a set of ground rules from MSC defining how the venting
situation should be handled.

3. _Braking Gates_: Based on mission requirements established by
ASPO, TRW showed a maneuver being made at the first braking gate to
reduce the closing velocity to 20 ft/sec. The consensus shows that
this magnitude is somewhat too low in that it tends to undesirably
stretch out the terminal phase, which increases the possibility of the
situation deteriorating, as well as possibly costing more fuel.

4. _Priority of Mission Objectives_: Repeatedly throughout the meeting 
we came upon situations in which mission objectives were in conflict
with each other and/or were undesirable in terms of excessive consumable
usage or mission complexity. Accordingly, it seems highly desirable
that the ASPO review the mission objectives and assign priorities defining 
the relative importance of the various mission objectives in order
that meaningful mission planning can be carried out both in advance of
the mission and in real time.

5. _Recontact_: Another problem area reidentified at this meeting
dealt with the possibility of recontact of the spacecraft with either
of the S-IVB's Or the LEM nose cone. Obviously, attention must be given
to the relative motion of all the many orbiting objects associated with
this mission.

6. _Stroking_: When and how the stroking tests are to be carried
out still remains ill defined with regard to such questions as the necessary propellant loading in the LEM at the time of the test, nature
of network coverage required, etc.

7. _Crew Rest_: Ground rules associated with the crew rest periods,
such as whether or not it is permissible or necessary that all crew members 
do sleep or do not sleep at the same time, has a heavy impact on
the scheduling of the various activities. Accordingly, it is necessary
that ground rules associated with crew rest be established at the earliest
possible time.

8. _CSM/LEM Separation for Re-rendezvous_: In each of the re-rendezvous exercises: TRW included a considerable period of time between
actual disconnection of the two spacecraft and the time at which the
first major maneuver is made to establish the desired conditions for
carrying out the terminal phase of each of the re-rendezvouses. It
was agreed that the procedure TRW had included in the Preliminary Reference Trajectory seemed as good as any; however, prior to development
of the follow-on documentation, it seems advisable to give further consideration to how we actually want to set up this procedure.

9. _Minimum SPS Maneuver_: A rather lengthy, but inconclusive, discussion 
centered on defining the minimum SPS maneuver which could be
carried out. This has particular influence on RCS propellant usage
in that the larger this minimum SPS maneuver is set, the more likely
it will be necessary to carry out maneuvers with the RCS. On the other
hand, it was noted that the capability of controlling the SPS engines
for these small maneuvers leaves something to be desired in that large
residual tumbling rates can result if the SPS thrust vector is not directed 
through the spacecraft e.g. and sufficient time is not given for
the guidance system to compensate for it. RCS fuel would then be required 
to stop the rates.

10. _Extra-vehicular Activity (EVA)_: The situation regarding EVA
is still badly clouded. This is the case in terms of how many EVA exercises 
should be carried out, when they should be scheduled in the
mission, whether the spacecraft should be docked or undocked, and, in
fact, even includes what appears to be a need for re-evaluating the
associated mission objectives. One thing that was clear, however, was
that not enough time had been included for these exercises. TRW had
provided about 1Â½ hours, whereas the Flight Crew Support Division (FCSD)
feels that 4 to 5 hours would be a more accurate estimate. It was also
noted that, as scheduled by TRW, ground coverage was inadequate particularly considering the fact that this will be the first EVA carried out
in the Apollo Program.

11. _Spacecraft Guidance Switchover_: Mission objectives have been
established which call for switchover from the primary to the backup
LEM guidance system during powered maneuvers. In order to provide maneuvers 
of sufficient magnitude to evaluate this procedure, it was necessary 
to orient them such that much of the energy is dissipated out-of-plane. 
Simultaneously, an in-plane component is provided for establishing 
the initial conditions for the re-rendezvous terminal phase for
each of the LEM active re-rendezvous exercises. This whole activity
seems highly undesirable in that it increases the complexity of the
mission to a great extent, has a good chance of fouling up the re-rendezvous 
exercise, and presents serious operational problems. For
example, the platform alignment must be in an attitude different than
would be used in an actual lunar mission in order to avoid gimbal lock.
In addition to perturbing the navigation carried out by the primary
guidance, it presents special problems with initialization of the
abort guidance system which is programmed to assume that the primary
inertial reference is aligned in the orbital plane. This is one example 
referred to in the previous note regarding relative priorities of
the various mission objectives.

12. _Ground Coverage Versus Lighting_: The Preliminary Reference
Trajectory was prepared such that all maneuvers were scheduled to occur
over ground stations to the greatest possible extent. No consideration
was really given to the lighting conditions for the rendezvous. This
was intentionally done since the Preliminary Reference Trajectory was
needed to supply the necessary information to make reasonable tradeoffs prior to preparation of the Reference Trajectory. It is obvious
that there will be a direct conflict between station coverage and
lighting which must be resolved prior to preparation of the Reference
Trajectory. Flight crew requirements associated with this are urgently
needed.

13. _LEM RCS Usage_: It was noted by several of the participants at
this meeting that the Preliminary Reference Trajectory as presented exceeds 
the LEM RCS capability in that ullage is only available when the
down-firing jets are used since there is no planned interconnect on
this flight. Did I say that right?

14. _Docked DPS Burn_: There was considerable discussion regarding the
LEM Descent Propulsion System (DPS) maneuver in the docked configuration. 
In particular, there was concern as to whether it should be carried 
out as scheduled early in the mission or as part of one of the
re-rendezvous exercises. Although there were problems associated with
both, the consensus was to leave it as scheduled; that is, one of the
Hohmann, transfer maneuvers to place the CSM/LEM in the 180 n.m. circular orbit prior to the first re-rendezvous exercise.

15. _Fire-in-the-Hole_: It appears that requirements associated with
camera coverage of the FITH should be established-as soon as possible.

There are undoubtedly other items I should have included here that I
either missed or forgot. At least they won't make this memorandum
any longer than it is.
