        SUBJECT: Comments on the AS-207/208 Preliminary Spacecraft Reference Trajectory
        TRW Systems released the AS-207/208 Preliminary Spacecraft Reference
        Trajectory during the first week of May. This report was put together
        on a compressed schedule, starting from rather hastily defined mission
        requirements. As a result, there are a number of things about it which
        were recognized as being in error even before release; however, since
        we have started so late in the development of this mission plan, it
        was Pelt the release of a rough cut such as this was better than to
        delay for a more polished one. This is not to criticize the TRW report; considering the conditions they did a good job. However, since
        a large number of directly concerned people were interested in learning
        about this mission plan in detail and since it was desirable to identify
        as many corrections as possible right away, I set up an informal presentation by TRI.1on May Il, to be attended by whoever was interested.
        At this meeting TRW reviewed the trajectory-oriented aspects of the
        AS-207/208 mission plan with primary emphasis on the four rendezvous
        exercises currently scheduled, g_e purpose of this memorandum is to
        document the discrepancies and open items discussed during the meeting.
        Assignment of action items was not the objective of this meeting and
        none were assigned.
        I would like to start out with a personal observation about this mission:
        Beyond a doubt, this mission plan is presently at least an order of m_agnitude more complex than any mission we will have flown before it. It
        was designed in an attempt to satisfy an overwhelming list of mission
        objectives established to test out spacecraft systems and crew procedures, both for nominal and for contingency situations. It is my feeling
        that, unless these mission objectives can be considerably cut back, we
        may be embarking on an unrealistic undertaking, including the development of a nominal mXssion plan which can really satisfy all of these
        objectives) the development of complex crew procedures, both to carry
        out that plan and to handle contingency-contingencies, and, perhaps
        most significant, the dumping of an overwhelming; if not impossible,
        load on the flight crew, hot only for preparation and training for the
        mission, but also its actual execution. _ais crev/ will be expected to
        check out the first Block II CSM, _n and check out a T,I_ for the first
        time, perform three or four completely different rendezvous exercises
        with different guidance systems and procedure% carry out two EVA exercises, perform a nu_oer of contingency operations, such as switching
        -.%,

        over from one guidance _ystem to another during prinu_ry engine burns,
        simulate crew rescue in terms of both rendezvous and crew transfer from
        one spacecraft to another by EVA, and so forth. It is to be noted that
        all of this is supposed to be done with spacecraft which have been designed for a specific mission--the lunar landing. That is, they have
        not beendeveloped with operational flexibility as a design criteria.
        And so with that introduction_ I would like to record here a number of
        the specific comments of this discussion:
        1. CSM/S-l-v-BSeparation: The Preliminary Spacecraft Reference
        Trajectory has the command module separating from the S-IVB after I hour
        and 41 minutes of mission time. We were informed that agreements currently in effect with_FC call for the CSM to stay with the S-IVB for
        at least two orbits and unless there is some problem associated with
        this, it would probably be preferable to retain that procedure.
        2. S-!VBVenting: There was some question as to how we would handle the problem.of spurious S-IVBventing in the event rendezvous is
        not carried out at the time scheduled. Of particular concern was the
        possibility of venting during the latter part of the rendezvous_ with
        the problem becoming more critical during the braking and docking maneuvers. According to the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO), M_FC
        is waiting for a set of ground rules from_C defining how the venting
        situation should be handled.
        3. Braking Gates: Based on mission requirements established by
        ASPO, TRW showed a m_neuver b_ingmade at the first braking gate to
        reduce the closing velocity to 20 ft/sec. The consensus shows that
        this n_agnitude is somewhat too low in that it tends to undesirably
        stretch out the terminal phase, which increases the possibility of the
        situation deteriorating_ as well as possibly costing more Fuel.
        4. Priority of Mission Objectives: Repeatedly throughout the meeting we came upon situations in which mission objectives were in conflict
        with each other and/or were undesirable in te_Hs of excessive consumable
        usage or mission complexity. According]_, it seems highly desirable
        that the ASPO review the mission objectives and assign priorities.definlng the relative importance of the various mission objectives in order
        that meaningikll mission planning can be carried out both in advance of
        the mission and in real time.
        5- Reeontaet: Another problem area reidentified at this meeting
        dealt with the possibility of recontact of the spacecraft with either
        of the S-IVB's Or the T._a{nose cone. Obviously, attention must be given
        to the relative motion of all the many orbiting objects associated with
        this mission.3
        6. Stroking: When and how the stroking tests are to be carried
        out still re_ins ill defined with regard to such questions as the necessary propellant loading in the I.EM at the time of the test, nature
        of network coverage required_ etc.
        7. Crew Rest: Ground rules associated with the crew rest periods_
        such as whether or not it is permissible or necessary that all crew members do sleep or do not sleep at the same time, has a heavy impact on
        the scheduling of the various activities. Accordingly, it is necessary
        that ground rules associated with crew rest be established at the earliest
        possible time.
        8. CSM/LF_4Separation for Re-rendezvous: In each of the rerendezvous exercises: TRW included a considerable period of time between
        actual disconnection of the two spacecraft and the time at which the
        first major maneuver is made to establish the desired conditions for
        carrying out the terminal phase of each of the re-rendezvouses. It
        was agreed that the procedure TRW had included in the Preliminary Reference Trajectoryseemed as good as any; however, prior todevelopment
        of the follow-on doeumentation_ it seems advisable to give further consideration to how we actually want to set up this procedure.
        9- Minimum SPS_ Maneuver: A rather lengthy, but inconclusive, discussion centered on defining the minimum SPS maneuver which could be
        carried out. This has particular influence on RCS propellant usage
        in that the larger this minimum SPS maneuver is set, the note likely
        it will be necessary to carry out maneuvers with the RCS. On the other
        hand_ it was noted that the capability of controlling the SPS engines
        for these small maneuvers leaves something to be desired in that large
        residual tumbling rates can result if the SPS thrust vector is not directed through the spacecraft c.g. and sufficient time is not given for
        the guidance system to compensate for it. RCS fuel would then be required to stop the rates.
        10. Extra-vehicular Activity (EVA): The situation regarding EVA
        is still badly clouded. _lis is the case in terr_s of how manyEVA exercises should be carried out, when they should be scheduled in the
        mission_ whether the spacecraft should be docked or undocked, and, in
        fact_ even includes what appears to be a need for re-evaluating the
        associated mission objectives. One thing that was clear: however_ was
        that not enough tinm had been included for these exercises. TRW had
        pro%_ded about 1½hours, whereas the Flight Crew Support Division (FCSD)
        feels that 4 to 5 hours would be a more accurate estimate. It was also
        noted tha% as scheduled by TRW, ground coverage was inadequate particularly considering the fact that this will be the first EVA carried out
        in the Apollo Program.
        ll. Spacecraft Guidance Switchover: Mission objectives have been
        established which call for switchover from the primary to the backup
        7I_ guidance system during powered maneuvers. In order to provide maneuvers of sufficient magnitude to evaluate this procedure, it was necess_ry to orient them such that _ch of the energy is dissipated outof-_ane. Simultaneously, an in-plane component is provided for establishing the initial conditions for the re-rendezvous terminal phase for
        each of the LEMactive re-rendezvous exercises. This whole activity
        seems highly undesirable in that it increases the complexity of the
        n_ssion to a great extent, has a good chance of fouling up the rerendezvous exercise, and presents serious operational problems. For
        example, the platform alignment nnlstbe in an attitude different than
        would be used in an actual lunar mission in order to avoid gimbal lock.
        In addition to perturbing the navigation carried out by the primary
        guidance, it presents special problems with initialization of the
        abort guidance system which is programmed to assume that the primary
        inertial reference is aligned in the orbital plane. This is one example referred to in the previous note regarding relative priorities of
        the various mission objectives.
        12. Ground Coverage Versus LightinE: The Preliminary Reference
        Trajectory was prepared such that all maneuvers were scheduled to occur
        over ground stations to the greatest possible extent. No consideration
        was really given to the lighting conditions for the rendezvous. This
        was intentionally done since the Preliminary Reference Trajectory was
        needed to supply the necessary information to make reasonable tradeoffs prior to preparation of the Reference Trajectory. It is obvious
        that there will be a direct conflict between station coverage and
        lighting which must be resolved prior to preparation of the Reference
        Trajectory. Flight crew requirements associated with this are urgently
        needed.
        13. I_ RCS Usage: It was noted by several of the participants at
        this meeting that the Preliminary Reference Trajectory as presented exceeds the LF_4 RCS capability in that ullage is only available when the
        down-firing jets are used since there is no planned interconnect on
        this flight. Did I say that right?
        l_. Docked DPS _rn: There was considerable discussion regarding the
        LF_ Descent Propulsion System (DPS) maneuver in the docked configuration. In particular, there was concern as to whether it should b& carried out as scheduled early in the mission or as part of one of the
        re-rendezvous exercises. Although there were problems associated with
        both, the consensus was to leave it as scheduled; that is, one of ti_
        Hohm_m_ transfer maneuvers to place the CSM/L_4 in the 180 n.m. circular orbit prior to the first re-rendezvous exercise.
        15. Fire-in-the-Hole: It appears that requirements associated _ith
        camera coverage of the FITH should be established-as soon as possib!_ _.There are undoubtedly other iten_ I should have included here that I
        either mi._;sedor forgot. At least they won't make this memorandum
        alkv longer th_n it is. __L_-__
