1.  Paul Kramer, Phil Shaffer, Duane Mosel, Ed Lineberry, and myself
spent the morning of May 7 trying to close out major open items
remaining on the \"C\" mission rendezvous.  These items were:

    a.  How to handle an excessive slip in TPI time.

    b.  What kind of cross checking and backup modes should be used for
    the TPI maneuver.

This memorandum briefly summarizes the results of our discussion.

2.  First of all, let me point out that without radar, it is important
that the CSM does not approach the S-IVB while in darkness since range
information is only obtained visually.  Also, the sun must not be too
near the line-of-sight - i.e., in back of the CSM - during braking for
the same reason.  These two contraints can be used to establish a \"window\"
of acceptable TPI times to provide optimum lighting during the braking
phase.

    a.  At this meeting we concluded that it is still best to locate TPI
    at the midpoint of darkness nominally.
    
    b.  In addition, we have specified that tolerable slip in TPI time
    is from 12 minutes early to 18 minutes late about that nominal time.
    That is, if the onboard solution for TPI time, based on the first sextant
    rendezvous tracking period following NSR falls within that period, no
    steps will be taken to change it.  (It is currently estimated that the 3Â°
    uncertainty of the onboard computation of TPI time at that point in the
    mission is 4 minutes.  Exceeding the bounds listed above by 4 minutes is
    not unacceptable.)
    
    c.  On the other hand, if the predicted TPI time slips earlier than 12
    minutes or later than 18 minutes, the TPI elevation angle will be adjusted
    as necessary to bring the TPI time _back to the closest bound_.  This is done
    as follows.  Let us assume that at the end of the first trackign period the
    TPI time is found to be more than 12 minutes early by having run through the
    TPI program (P34) using the \"elevation angle option.\"  P34 would be recalled
    using the \"TPI time option\" and the crew will input a TPI time exactly 12
