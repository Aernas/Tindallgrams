On Friday morning, July 19, we had a \"C\" Mission Retrofire and Reentry
Mission Techniques meeting to clean up some open items.  It is evident
that a distribution of correction pages to our previously distributed
Mission Techniques document will be inadequate and it is our current
plan to republish the whole book.  Some of the most significant items
resolved at this meeting are described in this memo.

1.  It has been established that the G&N guidance system will be
used in the event of a hybrid RCS deorbit.  (A hybrid deorbit is one
in which both the command module and service module RCS jets are used.)
The retrofire will be targeted for a half-lift reentry.

2.  It has been established that the G&N is mandatory for performing
a hybrid deorbit; thus, if the G&N has failed and the service module
RCS remaining has fallen below the return-line limits, the only remaining
system for retrofire is SPS using SCS control.  Accordingly, there is a
mission rule that retrofire will be performed to land in the next best
planned recovery area (PLA).

3.  It has been established that if insufficient time is available
for a fine alignment prior to retrofire, the G&N will be used with a
coarse alignment if that can be done.  Current estimate is that a
coarse alignment will be to within 2° on all axis, which can result
in as much as a 30 mile landing point miss.

4.  In the absence of response to our request for better numbers,
we have established the following limits beyond which the G&N will be
declared No Go for reentry and the backup system will be used.  The
DSKY VG displays must be within _1 fps_ and the gimbal angles must be
within _1°_.  Guidance and Control Division and MIT people please pay
particular note.

5.  Apparently the procedure has been established that command
module separation from the service module will be performed following
retrofire while still in the SPS thrust program (P40).  This is to
keep Average G on during the separation maneuver without having to
wait one minute as the entry programs are currently coded.  The entry
programs (P61, P62, etc.) will be sequenced after separation.  Thus,
these programs are being used in a completely different way than they
were designed.

6.  IMU PIPA and gyro drift compensation values are monitored continuously
by MCC-H.  It has been established that if the values currently
loaded in the G&N are in error by more than .003 ft/sec² and .075°/hr,
they will be updated in the CMC.
