subject: Status of the lunar module "quick return" guidance capability

This note is in response to your query regarding the "quick return"
capability being provided in the lunar module (LM) for aborts during
the lunar descent phase. As you recall, I reported deletion of a program
in the LM computer for generating coefficients to be used in an
abort polynomial to retarget the LM powered flight to provide a direct
intercept rendezvous trajectory. You asked how far this work had progressed
since you felt such a capability would be "comfortable."

In answer to that question, MIT Informed me that, whereas the concepts
were well established, there was still a considerable amount of work
required to complete this particular program. Furthermore, we have
also deleted the direct ascent launch guidance, which is a necessary
companion program. Certainly of more interest to you now is, what is
our current capability. 

The program is being written such that abort action by the pilot during
powered descent will cause the guidance to retarget to the standard LM
insertion orbit. Incidentally, it is necessary for the astronaut to
select which engine, the Ascent Propulsion System (APS) or the Descent
Propulsion System (DPS), is to be used, depending on the situation.
In any case, following insertion into orbit, the crew has two choices:
either to proceed with the concentric flight plan, or to use a processor
which we have retained for just such situations as this, whereby
the crew may obtain the two-impulse Lambert solution for rendezvousing
with minimum ΔV--essentially a direct intercept. In effect, the latter
provides very nearly the same capability as we have deleted, except that
the maneuver must be carried out in two steps with some delay--say, five
or ten minutes--between them, as opposed to a single maneuver.

If the concentric flight plan is chosen, the time between the abort
action and rendezvous would be about 2½ hours with the differential
altitude varying between 42 nautical miles above to the standard 15
nautical miles below the CSM, depending on whether the abort took place
immediately after initiation of the descent maneuver or at the end of
the hover. The "direct intercept" approach would take about l½ hours
but is only possible prior to initiation of hover since after that time
the intercept trajectory, unfortunately, also intercepts the moon--first!
Actual procedures have to be settled, but I feel we're in pretty good
shape here.

Finally, regarding current status, there are some unresolved problems
associated with this retargetting which MIT is currently addressing.
For example, if an abort occurs early in descent, the LM will be near
50,000 feet with orbital velocity. The current insterion altitude is
60,000 feet. Thus, the spacecraft would have to make a large altitude
change with little increase in velocity, which would obviously demand
some rather wild gyrations of the spacecraft--both highly undesirable
and unnecessary.
