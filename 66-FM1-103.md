As you know, MIT is currently designing the command module and lunar 
module computer programs without provision for automatic braking 
maneuvers. There has been some thought to reversing this direction. 
However, Don Cheatham, Aaron Cohen, and I agreed today to proceed as
we are for the AS-207/208 programs--that is, do not provide automatic 
braking maneuvers in the computer programs--since we are fairly sure 
that this capability should not be required for that flight. We will 
review this decision later for the AS-504 programs, based on experience 
gained during the AS-204 mission and from crew training and simulations, 
after more complete crew procedures are defined.
