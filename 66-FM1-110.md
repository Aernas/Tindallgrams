During our discussion at MIT last week, the question came up as to
whether it is necessary to have trajectory integration techniques in
the LGC for the trans-earth phase of the mission as well as the lunar
phase.  The argument is that if we are serious about using the LM
descent propulsion system to back up the command module SPS during
the trans-earth phase, it will be necessary to have this integration
capability as a service program for such things as platform alignment
and maneuver targeting.  In fact, this capability would also be
required for trans-lunar aborts using the DPS, I suppose.  The more I
think about it, the more I am convinced that this capability should
be included and I am interested in your comments on the subject.  Of
course, if you agree I assume you will include it in the 504 LGC
program requirements.
