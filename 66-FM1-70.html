</header>

<p>Tom Gibson and I went to MIT on May 25 and 26 with one of our primary
objectives to determine exactly what the program schedule situation
was for the AS-504 (AS-207/208) spacecraft computer programs. Although 
we had a number of very fruitful discussions with MIT people,
such as Ed Copps, Dick Battin, John Dahlen, and Bob Mallard, on this
subject, we really did not find out what we wanted to know. However,
I am very encouraged to see the enhusiasm and vigor with which Ed
Copps is attacking this problem.</p>

<p>d has set June 3, 1966, as a target for getting out the first cut at
a Program Development Plan, which he is anxious to talk to us about
during the following week. In fact, he intends to come down then not
only to talk over the program as he has put it together but also to
discuss its preliminary output regarding the AS-207/208, 503, and 504
schedule situation. Tom and I concluded that it would be better to
accept this delay than for us to attempt to do the job ourselves,
which is for all practical purposes the same thing he is trying to
do. Our main objective, of course, is to find out what the pacing
items are so that maximum attention can be given to these items in
an attempt to bring what is expected to be an unacceptable schedule
more into line. Possible lines of attack are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Review and, if possible, reduce or simplify our requirements
involving the pacing programs.</p>

<p>2. Give top priority to programmers working on those routines
for computer access.</p>

<p>3. Authorize somewhat inefficient use of computer storage by
those programmers to speed up the coding process, even at the sacrifice
of deletion of other routines.</p>

<p>4. Reassignment of personnel to the critical areas even though
inefficient.</p>

<p>5. Reassignment of certain tasks from people working on the critical 
systems to other groups, such as AC Electronics, MSC, or other
internal MIT units, etc.</p>

<p>It is <span class="ul">not</span> our intention to dispute MIT estimates of time required to
carry out specific tasks, shortening the time to anticipate delivery,
by telling them to do a job in two months which they feel requires
three; although, of course, these estimates must be carefully examined
to assure ourselves we are getting the correct picture.</p>

<p>It is to be emphasized that we must look at the overall schedule situation 
and not Just the program for a specific flight. There are obvious
interactions end trade-offs that could be made between the programs
for AS-207/208 and those for AS-503 and AS-504. If all efforts to remain 
within the flight schedule fail and the programs do become pacing
for these flights--as they very well could be--we must be in a position
to understand the trade-off of flight schedule delays of one mission
as compared to another.</p>

<p>A couple of items which Ed Copps did tentatively identify as problem
areas which might be influencing the schedule are the following:</p>

<p>1. Special guidance programs are required to enable yaw steering
during the lunar orbit insertion maneuver, providing for plane change
in excess of 6°. Ed says the Design Reference Mission calls for a 12°
capability, although he doubts that other spacecraft systems constraints
would permit such great plane changes. Accordingly, he asked us to
re-examine this specification to determine if we could live with a 6°
plane change capability, thereby avoiding the necessity of formulating
and including these special guidance programs.</p>

<p>2. Everyone at MIT seems to feel that the preparation of the Guidance 
System Operations Plan (GSOP) is the most critical of al] items
since so much of the work must be delayed until this final definition
of program requirements is finished. Accordingly, we will attempt to
take all possible steps to assist MIT in this work, including having
MSC people stationed at MIT to assist in the development of the GSOP
and, almost simultaneously, giving MSC approval of it. Also, it is
intended to work on the more critical pacing items first as ones are
identified and initiate procedures whereby official MSC approval can
be obtained on these parts as they are completed rather than waiting
for delivery of the entire package.</p>

<p>I'd like to make one final observation regarding the overall situation.
It's probably terrible; I really don't know yet. <span class="ul">But</span> it's my feeling
that everything that can be done to help has been done. We are reacting
to the problem areas as fast as possible; MIT has reorganized in what
seems to be the best possible way, and they appear to be getting things
on a businesslike basis, which up to now has probably been our worst
problem.</p>
