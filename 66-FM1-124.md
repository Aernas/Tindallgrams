September 29th shall probably go down, a least in my diary,
as the day of a major breakthrough at MIT. On that date we had an all
day meeting attended by all key MIT management personnel involved in
spacecraft computer program development. I expect it to be the first of
similar weekly sessions for as long as they are required. The purpose
of these meetings is to establish detailed program development plans for
the spacecraft computer programs. This basic information is required
for the obvious purposes of understanding the schedule situation, of
evaluating the impact of program changes and additions, of assigning
priority of effort - both manpower and facilities - in the optimum
manner, of providing vital information to NASA program management for
consideration in their decisions, etc.

I must say I was tremendously impressed with the cooperative, earnest
support all of these MIT people gave to this effort this time and have
every hope that it will continue for the four to six weeks of hard,
weekly meetings I expect will be needed to reach our objectives.

At this meeting, most of our attention was spent on two items which I
will discuss in some detail. First was the availability and adequacy
of the computer facilities needed for computer program development, and
the second was our investigation into the use of the AS-278 computer
programs with minimum change for the AS-503 mission.

At present MIT has two 1800 digital computers on which all program development
and verification is carried out. These machines have been and
are currently completely saturated. There are no other facilities in the
entire universe, to our knowledge, of proper configuration to relieve this
situation completely. This is identified as a major problem area particularly
during the months of November and December. However, an IBM 360
is to be installed at MIT very soon and it is currently estimated that
it will be on line no later than February 1st. As you recall, we have
funded AC to the tune of about $300,000 to develop a facility in Milwaukee
for use on Block I program development, i.e., for AS-501/502. It
was emphasized that maximum utilization of this facility is essential.

It was discovered during program development for AS-204/205 that the hybrid
facility at MIT was an extremely valuable tool for program debugging.
This is apparently because it is so easy to get on and off this machine;
in addition, it runs considerably faster than the digital computer. Thus,
it is possible for the programmers to check program fixes quickly and
determine whether they seem to be working before committing the program
to the all-digital tests. Phil Felleman of MIT presented a complete
schedule of the tasks currently planned for the hybrid computer through
calendar year 1967. This schedule showed that almost continually there
are a number of vital tasks which must be carried on simultaneously, or
at least on a time sharing basis. _This_ is expected to present serious
problems and we are currently looking into the possibility of augmenting
the facility to relieve it. In particular, an almost ideal set of hybrid
equipment is available at Beckman - a system which had been under development
for MPAD - which MIT can obtain immediately at a "bargain price".
Additional pieces of equipment such as a Block II AGC and a core rope
simulator must also be obtained from some, as yet, unknown source. MIT
is continuing to formulate plans for augmenting this facility including
obtaining for us the influence it would have in improving the computer
program development schedule. Specifically, this augmentation would
make possible the simultaneous use of the command module and LM cockpit
simulators at MIT. In addition, it would give the unique capability of
being able to run data flow tests and simulations of these two spacecraft
in conjunction with each other, which will certainly be highly desirable
for preparation of the AS-278 mission. It was strongly emphasized that
the purpose of this facility is not flight crew training, but rather is
for the development of the spacecraft computer programs and associated
crew procedures.

The second half of the day was spent in discussions of how the AS-278
programs could be used in support of the AS-503 mission. A number of
routines were considered for beefing up the AS-278 program, but after
lengthy discussions only two candidates were left outstanding. One was
the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) program which is certainly not needed to
fly the AS-503 mission, but which it might be advantageous to test on it.
The second and mere important processor which we probably _must_ add to
AS-278 is the trans-lunar injection (TLI) steering of the SIVB. This
program will probably be needed to obtain the experience of AGC steering
the SIVB on AS-503 before it is used for the actual TLI maneuver on
AS-504. Of course, it is not yet certain that the AGC will be used for
this purpose on AS-504, but its likelihood is great enough that we should
be prepared for this important spacecraft systems test.

Our next meeting will be Wednesday, October 5th during which, among other
things, we expect to review program plans MIT is preparing based on the
following ground rules:

1. Schedules should show influence of augmenting the hybrd facility.
2. They should be based on the assumption that the AS-503 _will_ be
flown using the AS-278 programs. The AS-278 programs will be augmented
as necessary to do this, but it is expected that no more than the two
processors noted above shall be added for that purpose.

Finally, I expect we will review open items remaining regarding the
"final" definition of the AS-278 program. Stand by for the next exciting
episode.
