There are a number of us who feel that the computer programs for the 
Apollo spacecraft will soon become the most pacing item for the Apollo 
flights. This is certainly likely to be the case for AS-207/208, by 
which time spacecraft, and booster delivery and Cape operations are 
likely to have become relatively routine, with the shots going pretty 
much on schedule, and we working on the computer program development 
will still be “sloshing through the mud.” In an attempt to improve
this situation--I hope improve--I have started to go to MIT a couple 
of days every week to provide coordination between MIT and MSC. This 
memorandum is the first of a series I will be dispatching to briefly 
inform you on what is going on.

During the week of May 16, we put primary emphasis on managenent matters. 
During that week, MIT put into effect a new Computer Program 
Development organization. Basically, what they have done is to put
Dr. Battin in charge of all computer programming, with four organizational 
units reporting to him. These units are headed by Mr. E. Copps,
Mr. N. Sears, Mr. J. Dahlen, and Mr. J. Nevins. I still do not have
a clear understanding of how their work is broken out between the four 
units; however, it is my understanding that Mr. Copps has been made 
responsible for program development; that is, the integration of the various 
program routines into a complete system, testing of that system 
through release of the ropes. In addition, they indicated that they 
have been authorized by MIT, and intend, to build up their program development 
staff with the intention of carrying on program development 
beyond AS-504. You will recall that there has keen some hesitancy on 
their part to augment their staff since they felt they would be phasing 
out, but apparently they have reached a management decision that they
will not phase out; and, accordingly, they are willing to hire more 
people, perhaps augmenting their staff by as many as fifty new people.

By some stroke of luck, Lyn Dunseith and I took Dick Hanrahan of IBM
to MIT that week to give them a briefing of our Program Development
Plan, the management technique which we implemented about a year ago 
with IBM for the MCC/RTCC, which has enabled us to know the current 
status of the programs as they develop to identify where our problem 
areas were and to evaluate quickly and accurately whether program 
changes could be made without schedule impact. Dick gave an excellent 
infomal briefing of this technique, which has served both IBM and
NASA wonderfully, and I hope and expect Mr. Copps will draw heavily 
on this experience in setting up a similar system at MIT. We have 
offered every assistance to him in this matter.

I am still very concerned about unnecessary sophistication in the program 
and the effect of this "frosting on the cake" on schedule and 
storage. It is our intention to go through the entire program, eliminating 
as much of this sort of thing as possible, I am talking about 
complete routines, such as "Computer Self-checks", as well as little 
features, such as including the third and fourth harmonics of the 
earth's oblateness and drag in programs for the lunar mission.

We also intend to maintain tight program control over MIT regarding
modifications of the AS-504 program for the AS-207/208. It shall be 
based on the principle that change shall not be made unless absolutely 
mandatory. Mandatory items are defined as those without which the system 
absolutely will not work. It does not include such things as adding 
earth's oblateness effects into the lunar rendezvous guidance programs, 
even though failing to include these effects will cause propulsion fuel 
to be wasted due to guidance errors. We will find out what the cost
of flying with a program like this is, and let you know. If it is too 
expensive, we will make the necessary program changes, but only after 
readjusting the delivery schedule as necessary.
