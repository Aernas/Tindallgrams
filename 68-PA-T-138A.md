This memorandum is to inform everyone in writing that MIT has now
agreed with MPAD that it is acceptable to use the same values of
the W-Matrix when reinitializing (after three marks of the last
batch of marks between NSR and PTI) as are used initially.  That
is, it is not necessary for the crew to punch new values into the
DSKY - a clumsy procedure everyone wanted to delete if possible.
I think Paul Pixley is the commended for finally getting MIT's
agreement to this crew procedure simplification.

The actual values to be used initially - that is, the pre-launch
erasable load values - have not been finally agreed to yet, but
that will not affect the crew procedures.  Today's best guess is
1000 feet and 1 fps.

It is recommended that the flight crew and those responsible for
documenting crew procedures, etc. adopt this mission techniques
immediately.  I have already told most of the concerned by the
Don Ameche.
