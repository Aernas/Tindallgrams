</header>

<p>Apparently it is planned to use the LEM radar while that spacecraft
is sitting on the lunar surface to determine the CSM's orbit. I am
told that the radar angle data accuracy is so poor it will not even
be used; the command module's orbit determination will be carried out
with range and range rate observations. Considering the extremely slow
rotational rate of the moon, I cannot for the life of me understand how
it will be possible to accurately determine the orientation of the command 
module's orbital plane. I am told they intend to do this after
the command module has made a plane change, which occurs a couple of
orbits before LEM ascent, and the results will be used to establish
orbital insertion conditions for the LEM launch targetting.</p>

<p>Could you analyze the situation, determining how well the various
orbital elements m_y be determined for the following data gathering
periods: (a) one-half pass, starting from horizon to directly overhead, 
(b) one complete pass from horizon to horizon, and (c) two
complete passes from horizon to horizon. I am also interested in
being informed about the correlation of the various orbital elements;
for example, orbital period and orientation of the plane.</p>

<p>I may have this all messed up and perhaps they do not really intend
to do the things in the way I understand it, but I certainly would appreciate 
it if you would make a rather abbreviated, order of magnitude
type, analysis of this within the next couple of weeks in order to determine 
whether it is even reasonable to include such a program in the
LEM computer or alternatively if it mnst be modified to make it insensitive 
to small bias and random errors in the radar data. I just can't
help comparing this to a single radar station on the ground where conditions 
are far superior and our results are not red hot.</p>
