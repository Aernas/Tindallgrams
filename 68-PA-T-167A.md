Although most of the things discussed in our Friday, July 19 \"C\"
Rendezvous Mission Techniques meeting are not of general interest,
there were a couple of things I would like to let you know about.

First of all, in an effort to reduce the probability of having to
make the NCC2 maneuver, which would be an extra SPS burn, it has
been decided to trim the NCC1 Î”V residuals if they are less than
10 fps.  In addition, the time of the NSR maneuver will be adjusted
in real time by as much as 30 seconds thereby changing the differential
altitude.  These two new things together should be adequate
to maintain the nominal TPI time, which is the primary objective in
targeting these maneuvers.  The nominal differential altitude, you
recall, is about 7.8 n.m. on the low side to 9 n.m. on the
high side.  These adjustment limits give us a capability of adjusting
the TPI time by about 20 minutes to account for dispersions.  Using
these procedures, it will only be necessary to make the NCC2 burn if we
encounter dispersions far in excess of those expected.

Something else which has been changed is that the elevation angle
at TPI is considered more sacred than any lighting limits at all and
should be retained at the nominal value at all cost even though the
so-called lighting limits are violated.  Previously the elevation angle
was to be changed if the lighting limits could not be met.

Another important mission rule adopted now is that the rendezvous exercise
will be terminated if the G&N fails prior to NSR, and probably will be
terminated any time the G&N fails.  This is to conserve SM RCS and permit
flying a full duration mission.

The changes to the mission techniques are relatively minor and it is
probable that it will not be necessary to reissue the entire document.
Rather than that, we will probably distribute change pages of some sort.
