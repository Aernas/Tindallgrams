1. It turns out providing justification for obtaining LM rendezvous
radar data during Ascent from the lunar surface is as difficult as
getting the data itself. this memorandum is to let you know that
unless some sharp cookie comes along with sufficient justification we
ain't gonna get it!

2. There have been numerous memoranda and discussions in which the
requirement for the use of the LM rendezvous radar during powered ascent
was stated primarily as a data source to evaluate the performance of
the ACS and the PNOCS both by the crew onboard the spacecraft and on
the ground. In addition, intuition supported this idea and so a good
deal of work has proceded based on the assumption that the rendezvous
radar data would be available. However, due to a series of circumstances
still beyond my comprehension, the LM spacecraft computer program -
Luminary - does not provide the capability for obtaining this
data. In fact, as far as I can tell it is deficient in two respects.
First, no automatic radar acquisition capability is provided during
ascent which would be mandatory since radar lock can only be acquired
after the big pitch maneuver at approximately lift off plus 10 seconds.
And, second, once it's locked on no provision has been made for getting
the radar data onto the telemetry downlink. Luminary change requests
are in the mill to add these capabilities. However, it is anticipated
that the schedule impact will be substantial, and since the current program
delivery schedule is only marginally acceptable, modifications to
it have to be in the mandatory category. In order to establish this
justification we discussed this subject in detail during the December
21 Ascent Phase Data Priority meeting. Much to my amazement, mandatory
justification does not appear to exist. The rationale for this statement
is the subject of the following paragraph. The point to be made
here is that unless a much stronger story can be put together, these
proposed program changes will probably be rejected and redenzvous radar
data will not be available either during powered ascent or immediately
after insertion into lunar orbit.

3. It had been proposed that rendezvous radar data was essential to permit the MCC to monitor ascent and advise the crew of the necessity to switch 
from the PNGCS to the AGS. How this would be done is thoroughly documented
elsewhere but basically it was intended to determine the range rate of the LM with respect to the command module utilizing the PNGCS LM state vector
and the AGS LM state vector separately, and then to compare these values
with that actually measured utilizing the rendezvous radar. This informatoin
would be displayed on analog plots in the control center. The same
comparison process would simultaneously be carried out with the range rate
as computed and measured along the line of sight between the LM and on an
MSFN tracking station. In each case, the rendezvous radar and the MSFN
provide an independent data source upon which to evaluate performance of
the PNGCS and the AGS. Studies to date indicate that in most cases of
guidance system malfunction, comparison against only the MSFN is adquate
to identify the errant system.

4. The most significant exception is certain accelerometer scale factor
or bias cases perpendicular to the line of sight between the LM and the
MSFN station. That is, the MSFN comparison is always capable of determining
unacceptable dispersions in flight path angle, but sometimes is not 
able to provide an independent measurement of the velocity magnitude
particularly when inserting into lunar orbit from a centrally located
landing site. The result is, if throughout ascent both the AGS and the
PNGCS appear to be operating properly based on all data available but
at insertion the PNGCS dhuts down the APS engine producing conditions 
which the AGS indicates to be suborbital, it will be impossible to determine
which guidance system is correct without rendezvous radar data.
Accordingly, it would be necessary to reinitiate thrusting immediately
probably using the RCS in order to provide safe orbital conditions based
on the AGS readout. Subsequently, MSFN tracking and/or rendezvous radar
measurements obtained as soon as possible will reveal whether it was the 
AGS or the PNGCS which was in error. If it truly was the PNGCS at fault
creating an underburn at insertion the proper action will have been taken.
On the other hand, if the AGS was in error the situation will be: the
rendezvous catch up rate will have been decreased to a point where an
extra revolution or so will probably be necessary, probably a lot of 
APS/RCS fuel will have been expended and, based on the (good) PNGCS and
MSFN the situation will have to be sorted out and handled on a contingency
basis. This particular set of circumstances is extremely unlikely. The
action taken is undesirable but not catastrophic. It would probably
require use of the command module to assist in the rendezvous but RCS is
being provided for that specific situation. Rendezvous radar data during
ascent and immediately following insertion would have prevented it from
happening but it does not appear to be mandatory. So unless the analysis
now underway disproves the above rationale, someone else comes alone with 
a good reason or if the Luminary program delivery impact turns out to be
small, I expect these requested changes will not be made in the first
version of Luminary, and maybe never. At this time I don't expect any 
of those things to turn out favorably. Furthermore, if we can't get this
data we probably ought to simplify the RTCC programs and MCC displays to
be compatible.

5. Finally, if we can't prove we need rendezvous radar data for Ascent,
it's about certain we wont' be able to for Descent either. But we do have
to have it on T/M while the LM is on the lunar surface for "launch site"
position determination and Ascent targeting. This data must be at a 
high update rate (10 to 30 samples per minute) and preferably without
"improving" the spacecraft state vectors in the LM computer.
