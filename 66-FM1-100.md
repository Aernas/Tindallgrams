---
During the week of August 15, we held a review of the AS-207/208 Guidance
Systems Operation Plan (GSOP) at MIT. Some things interested me which
I will pass on to you here. I will also include some of the more significant 
decisions--that is, direction to MIT--that were made at that
time

1. It is currently planned that the astronaut will freeze the rendezvous 
maneuver sequence by a manual input to the computer. This will
be done at about twelve minutes before each of the maneuvers, including
the TPI maneuver. It serves to prevent new observational (e.g., radar)
data from changing the maneuver he intends to make next. It does this
by causing the computer to completely ignore all new observational data
obtained between the time of his signal and the maneuver. In fact,
whatever data is collected during that period is never used, even after
the maneuver has been executed.

2. Logic is being introduced into the rendezvous navigation program
(i.e., the orbit determination used during rendezvous) which, in effect,
edits the observational data automatically. Specifically, if the change
in both the computed velocity magnitude and the computed position of the
spacecraft is less than some pre-established amount due to the processing
of new observational data, that data is adjudged to be good and is automatically 
included in the solution. If the change, in either of these
quantities is in excess of some larger pre-established amount, the data
is not accepted (unless the crew permits it), an_ a program alarm light
comes on. If the change in those quantities falls between these two
limits, the data is accepted and used, but the alarm light would be lit.

3. MIT was directed not to provide a mode for utilizing Alignment
Optical Telescope (AOT) data in the rendezvous navigation. This had been
tentatively suggested for use in the event of a rendezvous radar failure
but, based: on the likelihood that the AOT data would not be of any value,
it was decided not to complicate the program to permit its use.

4. Due to fear of some ambiguity, the computer program is designed
to reject radar data when the estimated range to the target exceeds
400 n.m.

5. One of MIT's questions left unresolved was whether or not an
automatic sextant search pattern is required as a lunar module acquisition
aid. MIT intends to make a recommendation on this.

6. The flight crew people have requested that the display of duration
of time in the terminal phase between TPI and TPF be in seconds.
Since this is not one of the standard time display formats, MIT was
directed to retain units of hours:minutes:seconds as they proposed,
unless the crew has really good reasons to provide this new format.
Tom Hardy has the action.

7. As usual, there was a discussion as to the reference to be used
in the display of altitude. MIT was directed to compute and display all
spacecraft altitudes referenced to a spherical earth with radius equal
to that of the launch pad. This reference was determined to be best,
although not perfect, for rendezvous missions after what seemed to be
endless months of discussion. Coordinates of landmarks used for orbit
determination, however, will be referenced to the Fischer Ellipsoid.

8. As a result of the crew's dissatisfaction with the fixed heads-down 
attitude forced upon them during SPS maneuvers on AS-204/205, MIT
proposes to eliminate that constraint in the AS-207/208 programs. The
computer will display a "preferred attitude," which is heads-up, but
will not automatically orient the spacecraft to that attitude. As I
understand it, it will hold whatever spacecraft "roll" attitude it happens 
to end up with when the thruster axis is properly aligned. It is
possible for the crew to manually change this attitude if it is undesirable 
by deactivating computer attitude control, then manually changing
the attitude and reinitiating computer control, which will then hold the
new attitude.

9. No minimum impulse capability is to be implemented in the LGC
since there appears to be no requirement for this, whatever it is.

10. As usual, the question of navigation (i.e., orbit determination)
in earth orbit came up again. We previously had directed MIT not to include 
this capability in the AS-207/208 mission programs since it is not
required for the lunar mission. However, they, and some MSC people, feel
it is desirable to provide this capability in order to obtain further
experience with the process prior to going to the moon. Thus, this is
still an open item. It has been agreed, in any case, that orbit determination
using unknown landmarks would not be included, and, although
the provision is being made for star/moon horizon measurements, they
will only be used to obtain CDU angles to be transmitted on the downlink 
and they will not be used in the navigation program.

Norm Sears estimates that the orbit determination process should 
be completed within about ten seconds of accepting an observation. Also,
he would like to establish a procedure whereby data points are obtained
at the rate of about one per minute.

11. MIT was directed to delete the guidance reference release (GRR) 
signal, its function to be replaced by the lift-off signal. As I understand 
it, there is some controversy over this which Aaron Cohen intends
to resolve at MSC.

12. One feature of this program which particularly disturbs me, and
many others, is the tremendous amount of work the astronaut must perform
to use the computer program. Of course, much of this comes about as a
result of the trade-off to provide mission flexibility by giving the
crew the capability of controlling what the computer is doing as opposed
to having it perform automatically. Another specific example is the
amount of data which must be input to the computer prior to making a maneuver, 
including such things as spacecraft weight and inertia, engine
trim angles, tailoff, spacecraft configuration (docked or undocked), and
level of rate response to hand controller inputs. It would certainly
be desirable, if possible, to eliminate as many of these inputs as possible, 
either by putting them in fixed memory--if that is a reasonable
thing to do--or by deleting them altogether. There is some question in
my mind as to how accurately some of them can be determined by the crew,
and we may find that there is no significant advantage obtained by updating 
them. This will be followed up.

I'm sure there was something else interesting that came up there, but I
don't remember it right now.
