It is currently intended to include some sort of tests in the LM descent
propulsion and guidance on the AS-503 mission.  However, it is not
possible to use the same guidance equations on AS-503 as will be used
on the AS-504 lunar descent.  This is due to obvious differences of an
earth orbital mission compared to an actual descent on the moon's surface.
The gravitational potential is different; the objective of the maneuver
is different; there is nothing for the lunar landing radar to bounce
signals off of, etc.  Accordingly it is MIT's intention, with our concurrence,
to omit certain vital parts of the AS-504 descent guidance
program from the AS-503 mission.  The purpose of this memo is to make
sure that you all know this.

It is my understanding that there are four main processers of the AS-504
descent guidance program which are not to be included in the AS-503
program:

1.  processing of the landing radar data
2.  landing point designation
3.  x-axis override
4.  automatic rate of descent control

In addition, there is likely to be a change in the coordinate system of
some sort needed.

I certainly do not claim to be an expert in descent guidance; in fact,
quite the opposite.  If anything above interests you, I would suggest
you contact someone who really knows what they are talking about like
Don Cheatham, Floyd Bennett or Tom Price.

Incidentally, we are currently in the midst of an exercise designed to
make the AS-278 spacecraft computer programs identical to those for
AS-503.  Although I don't expect this to have any influence on the
descent guidance, I just mentioned it here to cover that possibility.
